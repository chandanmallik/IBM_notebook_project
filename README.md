# FALCON9_Landing_project




### This is a project where we import the data from various sources and then do analysis on it to find meaning full insights.



 Project background and context
Space X advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because Space X can reuse the first stage. Therefore, if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against space X for a rocket launch. This goal of the project is to create a machine learning pipeline to predict if the first stage will land successfully.
â€¢ Problems you want to find answers
- What factors determine if the rocket will land successfully?
- The interaction amongst various features that determine the success rate of a successful landing.
